Project overview: It has often been observed that energy consumption tends to be at its highest on days with
hotter temperatures. As a data scientist, you have been tasked with developing models that
predicts the maximum daily energy use and pricing based on weather data. The hope is that
these models can be used to predict likely energy demands based on a weather forecast, which
can help energy companies understand plan for future usage, and help businesses plan when
to conduct energy-intensive operations.
